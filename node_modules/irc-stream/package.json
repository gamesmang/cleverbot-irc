See [flight-stream](https://github.com/clux/flight-stream) for an example as using it as a writable stream only.\n\n\n## Options\nThe fourth argument control how we listen on IRC. By default the following options are all disabled or zero:\n\n```js\n{\n  allErrors: Boolean, // manually handle `irc` error events\n  ignoreChannel: Boolean, // ignore channel directed messages\n  answerPms: Boolean, // respond to private messages\n  neverHighlight: Boolean // never highlight channel responses\n  alwaysHighlight: Boolean // always highlight channel responses\n  participationChance: Number // probability to respond without being addressed\n}\n```\n\nNB: Can only do one of `neverHighlight` and `alwaysHighlight`. By default, `irc-stream` will highlight the channel recipient on the first message only.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install irc-stream\n```\n\n## License\nMIT-Licensed. See LICENSE file for details.\n",
